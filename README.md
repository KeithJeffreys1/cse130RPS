This is a command-line-based game of rock, paper, scissors that runs through a terminal interface. The game offers two modes of play which are player vs. player (PvP) and player vs. computer (PvCPU). In both modes, player number one is prompted to enter the target score that must be achieved to result in a winner. At the start of the game, both players begin with zero points.

To intensify the gameplay, there are actions that each player can use to help them claim victory. These actions include 'T', which allows a player to steal a point from their opponent, 'M', which matches the points of both players, and 'Z', which resets the opponent's points to zero. Also, there is a 'F' mechanism that guarantees a round ot round victory over any other user selection in the game. 

The game provides an interactive and strategic experience, allowing players to employ these methods strategically to gain an advantage and emerge as the winner.
